<p>I am an imaging scientist, with a focus on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) - the most widely used modality to study human brain activity non-invasively. FMRI now provides the resolution to resolve individual differences in functional brain network patterns, offering an exciting window to study the brain under development and in healthy and diseased states. However, low sensitivity and detection biases from the hardware and brain anatomy itself limit our ability to derive accurate and robust results. **My goal is to fully harness the information content of modern, technologically advanced fMRI.**</p>
<p>I have experience in MRI sequence programming, image processing and analysis and a massive curiosity about the brain. I am conviced that a thorough understanding of fMRI signal formation will allow us to correct for detection biases and construct an ever clearer picture of the brain.</p>
